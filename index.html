            Online education enables the teacher and the student to set their own learning pace, 
            and there’s the added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone’s agenda. As a result, using an online
             educational platform allows for a better balance of work and studies, so there’s no need to give anything up. 
             Studying online teaches you vital time management skills, which makes finding a good work-study balance easier. 
             Having a common agenda between the student and teacher can also prompt both parties to accept new responsibilities
              and have more autonomy. </p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> We also need to acknowledge that the transition to virtual learning 
            can be challenging for all stakeholders. Parents will have to think differently about how to equip their 
            children in the virtual learning space; how to create structures and routines that allow their children to be successful; and how 
            to support their learning journey while considering the emotional well-being as well. Schools like hospitals 
            are caregivers and we, as a school will fall back on the school framework 
            of Relevance, Relationship and Rigour to support parents in this process of creating meaningful
             engagement with their children.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">illiteracy has many interrelated causes and effects. ... Thus, one could easily argue
             that the increase in literacy is directly correlated with positive economic growth.
             In the past, education was not required, but in this day, universal education is becoming a necessity.
            The Main cause is - 
            Lack of books at home and lack of stimulation as to the importance of reading; Doing badly at or 
            dropping out of school—many have not completed high school,
             Difficult living conditions, including poverty; Learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, dysorthographia, etc.</p>
